In February 2017, I got the chance to give the "Advanced" talk at the monthly [DenverScript Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/DenverScript/). The talk was called "Unit Testing React Components" - I had struggled through learning frontend testing fundamentals for a previous project, so I figured that it'd be good for me to pass that knowledge along, and get a sweet video out of it in the process.

Huge thanks to [Matt Webb](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewwebb/) for letting me crash his Meetup, and [On The Line Productions](https://www.onthelinevideo.com/) for the awesome video.

[Check out the slides here](/slides/denverscript), and you can [watch the full video of the lecture on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9ZBVLKdu08).

Enjoy!
