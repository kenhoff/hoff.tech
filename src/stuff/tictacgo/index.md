Quick and dirty project to implement [Tic Tac Toe](https://www.google.com/search?q=tic+tac+toe) in [Go](https://golang.org/). I've been feeling the need lately to get up-to-speed on a systems-level language, and Go seemed like the perfect choice.

There's not much to this game - one difficulty (stupidly easy). Mostly just a chance for me to get familiar with Go's syntax and write some nontrivial code.
