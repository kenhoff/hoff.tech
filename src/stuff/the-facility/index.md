The 2014 [Global Game Jam](http://globalgamejam.org/) was one of the most interesting experiences I've had making a game. I had a lot of trouble coming up with an idea for the theme, **"We don't see things as they are, we see them as we are."** I settled on a top-down escape-the-mental-hospital game, where the player's imaginary demons would be more prominent as their sanity decreased (like [Don't Starve](http://www.dontstarvegame.com/) or [Amnesia](http://www.amnesiagame.com/)).

I originally planned to work solo during this event, but I was fortunate to have some really talented people that helped me out. [Kacy Corlett](http://kacydoodles.tumblr.com/) is responsible for all the art, and was absolutely amazing to work with!

Unfortunately there isn't a playable version due to some interesting controller issues, but there's a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzOXV4v8sy4) video of me playing the game. Turn up the volume!
