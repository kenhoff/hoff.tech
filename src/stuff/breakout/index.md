Have you tried out [PICO-8](http://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) yet? It's pretty cool.

I whacked together this game over a day or two while offline at a cabin [near Winter Park](https://goo.gl/maps/GywJKeN41372).

Figuring out how to make the paddle angle the ball was surprisingly hard.

> Fun fact: The entirety of the game's code is contained within the image of the cartridge, so that PICO-8 players can _literally_ send and share cartridges with each other. **Algebraic!**

[Play it here.](play) Enjoy!
