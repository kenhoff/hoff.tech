My first experience with writing video games from scratch was an attempt at [Asteroids](http://www.freeasteroids.org/). It's written in C++ with [legacy OpenGL](http://www.opengl.org/wiki/Legacy_OpenGL) and [SFML](http://www.sfml-dev.org/). It's incomplete, but it has shooting, thrust, rotational inertia, and asteroids that break apart. There's no web player, but if you'd like to compile it yourself, you'll need OpenGL, SFML, and a Unix-based OS.
