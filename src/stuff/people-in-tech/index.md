In May 2018, I was approached by Caleb King of the [People In Tech podcast](https://www.peopleintech.us/), to see if I wanted to come on the show and chat about the project I had just launched - [Winds](https://getstream.io/winds), and open-source RSS reader and podcast player.

It was a bunch of fun! Caleb and I chatted for about a half hour about all the lessons and learnings that were put into Winds - I rambled a little bit about my experience with building showcase apps, some user testing anecdotes, and advice for developers just starting their adventures in open-source contribution.

You can [listen to the podcast in its entirety here](https://anchor.fm/people-in-tech/episodes/Open-Source-Success----052218-e1gk8h/a-a3jd2t) (skip to 4:18 for my introduction). Enjoy!
