The [8-bit History](http://www.8bithistory.org/) Game Jam wanted "short, simple 8-bit style games that address contemporary social issues."

I decided to make a game about something that I've felt a lot of passion about since I was a kid - violence in video games.

Originally, I had designed this big, complicated game that felt a little like [Hotline Miami](http://www.hotlinemiami.com/), but then I realized that I was just making a less flashy version of Hotline Miami, and decided to scope waaaaaaay down.

I'm pretty happy with the result. Even with it being a tremendously stripped down game, it's kind of pretty and elegant.
