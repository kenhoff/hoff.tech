Winds 2.0 is an open-source podcast player and RSS reader, built in Electron, React, Redux, and Node.js. It was built as a content marketing project - a nice way to show off the capabilities of Stream, as well as provide content and examples for blog posts.

You can download and use it over at <https://getstream.io/winds/>, check out the [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/GetStream/winds), and read a bit more about the launch over on [the Stream blog](https://getstream.io/blog/winds-2-0-its-time-to-revive-rss/).

I spent about 6 months working on Winds - I built about 90% of the frontend, and about 50% of the backend.
It was a period of tremendous growth for me - getting to put a bunch of new techniques to work on a big hairy web app, and learning to work with a team of diverse skillsets and abilities.

I have loads of stories that I can tell about Winds, but I think I'll keep it offline for a while - buy me a beer sometime and I'll tell you about it :)
