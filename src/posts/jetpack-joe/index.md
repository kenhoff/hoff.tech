[Ludum Dare](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/) is a 48-hour game development competition (or a 72-hour game development "jam"). The 23rd annual competition's theme, "Tiny Worlds," was open to any interpretation that the creators desired. My team (which consisted of myself, [TJ](http://www.yakuprising.net/teej), and [Dane](https://larsendt.com/)) participated in the game jam event and developed "Jetpack Joe and the Tiny Worlds," a top-down 2D space game. The player attempts to get to the finish line by using orbital dynamics and a jetpack to slingshot themselves around planets, while avoiding colliding with any of them.

We used C++ with a combination of [legacy OpenGL](http://www.opengl.org/wiki/Legacy_OpenGL) and [SFML](http://www.sfml-dev.org/), with a simple text-based level parser. I was responsible for music, some game design, and cooking. We all learned a lot; mostly that we have no idea how to compile for windows, so it only runs on linux with OpenGL and SFML installed. You can check out the [tumblr](http://ludumdurr.tumblr.com/) that we updated during the event, but be warned - it gets a little crazy near the end, due to lack of sleep.
