    <h1>Hi! I'm Ken Hoff.</h1>
    <section>I'm looking for a meaningful full-stack JavaScript IC, team lead, or devrel role. I'm particularly interested in dev tooling and social impact - renewables, carbon, voting reform and electric cars are all particularly interesting to me.</p>
    <p>I'm a competent full-stack JavaScript developer with excellent communication skills and attention to detail. I'm extremely strong at taking fuzzy business problems and solving them end-to-end, with fully realized software deployed to thousands of users.</p>
